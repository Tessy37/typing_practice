A naval arms race among Argentina, Brazil and Chile—the wealthiest and most powerful countries in South America—began in the early twentieth century when the Brazilian government ordered three dreadnoughts, formidable battleships whose capabilities far outstripped older vessels in the world's navies.

In 1904, the Brazilian legislature allocated substantial funds to improve the country's naval forces. The plan's proponents believed that a strong navy was a requirement in becoming an international power, and was needed to combat recent naval expansions in Argentina and Chile. The revolutionary design of the 1906 British warship HMS Dreadnought induced the Brazilians to alter these plans,[B] redirecting their money into constructing three larger Minas Geraes-class dreadnoughts; two would be constructed immediately. These warships, the most powerful in the world, would enter service at a time where dreadnoughts were a measure of international prestige. They therefore brought global attention to what was perceived to be a newly ascendant country.

Although these two warships were completed and delivered, the third Brazilian dreadnought faced a different fate. Preliminarily named Rio de Janeiro, the incomplete vessel was sold to the Ottoman Empire in 1913 in the face of a slowing economy, significant political opposition after a 1910 naval revolt, and the ship's being outclassed by ever-larger super-dreadnoughts.
